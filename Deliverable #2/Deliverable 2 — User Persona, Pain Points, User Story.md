# Deliverable 2: User Persona, Pain Points & User Story

## Who are your constituents/clients/users?

- **Businesses** which directly cause and/or indirectly facilitate CO2
  emissions, and wish to offset in order to hit climate targets,
  achieve tax rebates, and improve their public image

- **Public sector organisations** which directly or indirectly cause
  CO2 emissions, and are under pressure from their governments who are
  behind plan on hitting the climate targets they pledged to in
  international agreements

- **Individual personas** (listed in the chronological order we expect
  them to emerge):

  - **Dani**, the technically-minded early adopter of web3 who is
    actively working in a blockchain startup

  - **Nick**, the Blockchain influencer who runs a DeFi website / blog
    and is a strong Ethereum advocate

  - **Frank**, the blockchain investor who sees potential in CO2ken

  - **Lisa**, the college graduate who works on web3 research for a
    non-profit think-tank and helps edits a weekly blockchain
    newsletter read by thought leaders in government and the private
    sector

  - **Alice**, a non-technical consumer who wants to offset the CO2
    emissions caused by her holiday flights, but has heard disturbing
    things about the trustworthiness of many carbon retailers

## What are their pain points?

- **Businesses** are struggling to:

  - maximise the "bang for buck" of their carbon offsetting budgets,
    by avoiding expensive offsets in which many intermediaries take
    a slice of the pie

  - keep track of all their offsets while avoiding spending
    significant time / money on additional accounting

  - prove to external auditors that they have offset CO2 emissions
    directly caused by their internal processes

  - integrate offsetting into their existing products and services,
    so that their customers can in turn easily perform offsetting

  - ensure that all these offsets go to trustworthy offset projects

- **Public sector organisations**

- **Individuals**

  - **Dani** needs to strengthen the value proposition of her
    startup's product, and expand the horizons of what she can achieve
    with blockchain.

  - **Nick** is struggling to find compelling new use cases for
    Ethereum, which he needs to drive more buzz around the ecosystem
    and attract more readers to his website.

  - **Frank** is fighting to get ahead of other VCs by finding
    exciting new projects with bold visions and a large target market.
    He wants to achieve ROI whilst investing in ethical and
    sustainable ventures.

  - **Lisa** wants to exceed her manager's expectations by finding
    surprising new blockchain projects and explaining their near- and
    long-term value to her public and private sector readers within
    their own organisations.

  - **Alice** is bewildered by the various carbon offsetting options
    available online, and needs to find a way to offset her own CO2
    emissions which she can trust will be held to the highest
    standards.

## What is your product's value proposition?

We are building the open carbon accounting ecosystem needed to achieve
our vision of global carbon neutrality by 2040.

By building our platform on blockchain, we can simultaneously solve the
key problems which plague the traditional carbon offsetting industry:

- Lack of reliability and accountability

- Too many intermediaries in the value chain causing money "leaks" and
  other inefficiencies

- Fragmentation of carbon markets

- Difficulty / inertia in building new products / services which bring
  offsetting to a larger audience

## What is your distribution and go-to-market strategy? Who can you partner with?

## What are the risks associated with your solution?

- Depending on your point of view, building anything on blockchain
  arguably entails some inherent risk.

- Even if blockchain succeeds long-term, there is no guarantee that
  Ethereum will be a long-term player (although of course we believe
  it will).

- The DAO will need to be backed by a legal entity, for which there is
  little precedent.  Getting the wrong setup could expose the founders
  to undesirable liability.

- DAO structures and the underlying technology are still relatively
  immature, and historically have had security bugs and other
  vulnerabilities exploited with disastrous consequences.

- Fixing the crypto-economic model (including CO2ken price, and
  potentially bonding curve parameters) correctly will be a challenge.
  Getting it wrong could prove extremely expensive.

- Building a reliable oracle to import CO2ken prices and other data
  into the blockchain has all the standard challenges inherent with
  oracles.

- Building an open platform allows others to take our Open Source
  code, replicate what we have done, and potentially take a chunk of
  our revenue.  However this could also be viewed as a successful
  outcome in that it validates the business model and further
  increases offsetting activity.

- Similarly, choosing the wrong Open Source license could provide too
  much or little restriction in terms of what and how components could
  be built on top.  However this should not be hard to mitigate.

## What is the impact of your solution? How will it be measured?

We have several very clear metrics of success:

- Number of offset certificates purchased and used to mint CO2kens
  via our Carbon DAO.  This measures how much additional *demand*
  for offsetting our platform is incentivising.

- Number of CO2kens burned.  This measures the net figure of emissions
  offset through the platform.

- Number of DAO members.  This measures engagement and confidence on
  the investor / supply side of the platform.

- Number of users of the offsetting smart contract
